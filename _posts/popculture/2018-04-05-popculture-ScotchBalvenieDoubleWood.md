So it has been a long time since I did a beer review. Well, there is a reason for this. I was mainly reviewing beers that are too rare and local. I mean not many people can even find these beers that I tout. For example, I had an amazing beer on Friday; Black Butte Imperial Stout XXVII special edition from Deschutes. It is a definite 5 stars. But where in the hell are you going to find it? Hey, where am I going to find this beer again? Or the Darkenfloxx from Cloudburst or the Mexican Biscotti Cake Mix from Evil Twin or the Big Bad Baptista from Epic Brewing? All 5 stars, all beers you can never find anywhere. 



But the problem is that I really like reviewing things.


So there is a solution.......whiskey reviews!!

Recently I have been really getting into whiskey (mainly Scotch), reading about it, trying different types, etc. And seeing that whiskeys (at least the one's I am tasting) are far more ubiquitous and can be found in most beverage stores, I think a whiskey review every so often would be perfect.



So let's start with the initial whiskey that prompted me into entering the pretentious world of whiskey:



The 12 Year Balvenie Double Wood!


With the reasonable price tag of ~$55, the Double Wood is about as good as you can get if you consider quality per ounce. 


Distilled in the northern part of Scotland in the region of Speyside (or as I have read, the 'Manhattan' of Scotch), The Balvenie takes on the standard characteristics of the Scotch made in Speyside; fruity, light on the peat, but ooohh so rich. 


The reason for the name 'DoubleWood' is pretty simple; it is aged for 12 years in traditional American Oak casks, then moved to Spanish Oloros sherry casks for 9 more months. So this oak-to-sherry aging is the distinct feature of the DoubleWood.


So does that make a difference? Honestly, I am not sure. My palette is still very new to the Scotch world, but I can tell you there is a sweetness in it that is claimed to have derived from the sherry wood. 

Now onto the tasting notes:


Nose: Sweet and fruity. I guess there is some honey in there as well, but I just read that part from a website.

Taste: Very good. It is so smooth and chewy, the rich sweetness is very well balanced with the sting of the alcohol. I highly recommend a splash of water to unleash the fruity tones. 

Finish: Long and strong (that's what she said). You will be tasting this one for awhile. And that's a good thing in this case.



At the local pub, a pour would cost around $10-$12; not a terrible price to pay considering a Macallan 12 year would run about $3-$5 more (and it is made in the same region with very similar tasting notes!). However, no need to drink this one at a bar, save some money and just buy a bottle! Sure, it is about $20 more than a Jameson or Bulleit, and there is always room for one of those on your shelf at home. But trust me, The Balvenie DoubleWood is definitely worth the extra money. I guarantee you will taste the difference.
