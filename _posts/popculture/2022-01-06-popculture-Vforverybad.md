Have you ever rewatched a show or movie that you loved from your past?


Of course you have. 

Now how many times have you rewatched said show and thought to yourself 'yeah,t hat's exactly how it remembered it'.

Yeah, probably not so much, huh.


That is what happened to me the other day. As I was scrolling through banal YouTube videos and found one on V. For you who know not of V, it was a miniseries in the mid 80's that told the tale of visitors (hence V) from another planet and how they tried to befriend and assimilate to our world. 

Or do they................


Spoiler Alert: they are in fact lizard people, and are trying to take over our world. Side note: Alex Jones thinks of this as a documentary, but I digress.....




Anyway, I saw this miniseries when it was one at around the age of 7 and thought it was the coolest thing I have ever seen. Sure, a lot was lost on me, like the obvious connection with this and the Cold War, but it did not dissuade me from falling in love with the action, the passion, the mystery, and those awesome red uniforms and blue blockers the V(istors) wore. I mean I was firing imaginary Uzis at the hip just like our hero, some...guy...I forgot.

So remembering the days of yore when I loved this show, I watched a bit on ye olde YouTube in hopes of recapturing some of that 80s sci-fi goodness. And upon further inspection, this show absolutely sucked! 


I mean sure, the special effects were lacking and some of the themes and attire were a tad dated, but I was prepared for that. What I was not prepared for was how bad the show sucked! The acting was bad, the dialogue was so stilted, the mysteries and reveals were oh so cliche, and sooo boring!! Holy lord was this show boring. I mean nothing would happened for literally 10 minutes, then another 10 minutes, then another 10 minutes, then I was asleep. I mean there was a lot of filler in between anything that would advance the plot. And that hero firing an Uzi from the hip, yeah.....not as cool as I remember. Yes, the show did have some potential and some of the set-ups were intriguing, but there was no payoff at all. At all!!


So I have come to two conclusions:

1. 80's TV dramas sucked. I mean it really sucked. I know your sense of nostalgia will make you think otherwise, but no. 80's TV dramas sucked. If you don't believe me, trying watching Knight Rider again.

2. Kids have absolutely no taste. Do not listen to them. They have no idea what a good or bad show is. Your kid doesn't know shit. Your niece/nephew doesn't know shit. And guess what, you and I didn't know shit when we were kids as well. 


Memory can play tricks on us; makes us remember things way better than they really were. That is not such a bad thing, just don't make decisions based on those memories.........like revisiting 80's TV.
