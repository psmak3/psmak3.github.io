Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors active today. Creators of such hits as the Dark Knight Series, Inception, Interstellar, and the vastly under-rated The Prestige, Nolan makes money making films that also have an air of sophistication to them. In fact, who around has a better batting average than Nolan?


But I feel a strikeout coming...........


Nolan has a new film coming out in a few months; Dunkirk. What is it about? Well, Dunkirk. More specifically, about the battle there in Dunkirk during World War II. You know World War II, right? The one that Hollywood makes movie after movie after movie after movie about.



In fact, a recent survey done by me estimates the amount of WWII movies made in Hollywood as 1000 per year!!! (Note: estimate is 1000 +- 995). WWII has become so cliche, it is even staler than a RomCom with Meg Ryan. 


And Christopher Nolan of all people! To delve into this unoriginal movie trope. The man who brought us such imagination and innovation in all of his previous efforts; dream exploration, interstellar journey with space/time theory attached, Batman being a ninja. Why is he going into the vanilla world of WWII re-creation?

There are so many other interesting ventures he can trudge. For example, why not do a movie with monkeys, or a movie that battle various winged creatures, or a movie where robots rule the earth, or a movie where the lead actor turns out to be a woman, or a movie where everything was just a dream (oh...he did that one already). And what about hobbits? We need more movies about hobbits!!! C'mon Chris, get on that instead of giving us another WWII show. You know that war was like 75 years ago.

I don't know, maybe it will be OK. I mean he is quite the talent. But I just have a bad feeling about this one. It was the same feeling I had before seeing Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. 

And we all knew how that one turned out.............
