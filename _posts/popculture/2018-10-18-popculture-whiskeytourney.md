Over the past weekend, I was in Nashville for a Whiskeyfest. So what is a Whiskeyfest? Well, simply put, it is a fest where you pay a lot of money to try as many high end whiskies as possible. 

At this particular fest, there were about 60 vendors with about 5-6 expressions a pop. So about 300+ whiskies were available to taste. So as any smart red-blooded whiskey connoisseur would do, I just went to as many vendors as I could and asked for the more expensive thing that got.


After about 40 tastes, I discovered something: I really really really like whiskey.

So this inspired me to do this:


The Great Whiskey Showdown (Part I)!!!!!!



- 36 whiskies! 

- Grouped in 3 conferences: American, Scotland, and Other


- Each conference with 4 divisions:

- American: Bourbon, Barrel Strength, American non-Bourbon, and Rye

- Scotland: Highlands, Islay, Other, and Cask Strength

- Other: Irish, Japanese, Blends, and Local





So the obvious question is, 'Is there a bracket?'.


Well of course!!!


But it is too hard to post it on here.....too....many...whiskies (it looks too small on here).


But here are the contestants (in no particular order, well, alphabetical I guess):


American: Blanton's, Bookers, Elijah Craig, Henry McKenna, High West, Michter's, Rittenhouse, 
Sazerac, Stagg Jr, Stranahan's, Westland, Wild Turkey

Scotland: Aberlour, Ardbeg, Auchentoshan, Balvenie, Benromach, Bruichladdich, Glenlivet, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Macallan, Springbank, Talisker

Other: 2Bar, Compass Box, Copperworks, Green Spot, Hakushu, Hibiki, Johnnie Walker, Nikka, Oola, Redbreast, Teeling, Yamazaki







After about 4 weeks, there will be an overall champion!


So how to partake in this? Well, just ask me and you are in!!! There are a few rules that need to be abided, but they are simple. I am one who wants to share his whiskey and share the joy of this fine elixir.
