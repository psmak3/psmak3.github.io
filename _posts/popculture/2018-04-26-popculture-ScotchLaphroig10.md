I saw a shirt the other day that said 'Scotch is what beer wants to be when it grows up'. I completely agree.

Not to say there is anything wrong with beer. I mean I live in a craft beer haven, and lords knows I have taken advantage of that. I have logged in over 250 different beers over the course of 4 years, and don't plan on stopping.


But it is not scotch.


Yes, I am all in on this scotch stuff. Sure, it is an expensive habit, but I would argue it is cheaper than wine. I mean with a bottle of wine, that can easily run you $40 and you have to drink it all in 2 days before if grows stale. A good scotch you can find for $80 easily and that can last you over a year. But if it is good, it probably won't.



So let's talk about one of my favorite scotches, the Laphroig 10 year. Now if you know anything about this quaff, you would know it is polarizing. I mean one of their taglines is 'Dividing Opinions Since 1815'.

I mean look at some of their ad campaign:

My buddy says it smells like feet, and hence calls it 'LaPheet'. He asks me if it is like cheese, where a reek-filled cheese can still taste different. I say 'No, it tastes like it smells'. 

Some are disgusted. Others love it. So here is my review:





Nose: Smoky and peaty. And I don't mean a hint of it. It assaults your nose with a bouquet of wild peat straight from the isles of the Islays. The nose does not apologize for entering your nasal canal, taking residence, and sitting there for hours, invited or not! 

Taste: It's like sucking the moss off a log, while that log is on fire. It punishes all your taste buds with a peaty/Band-Aid/dirty sock taste that only can be chronicled by the greatest bards of times past.

Finish: After you exhale, your mouth is filled with a smoky residue that lingers on. Later that smoke morphs into a sweet subtle aftertaste that juxtaposes the initial tasting. Oh don't worry, it still tastes like you have sweaty socks stuffed in your mouth, just with a bit more vanilla involved. 



I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is what scotch drinkers drink; hard and strong single malt peaty goodness. As for cost, a mere $55 can get you a bottle of this libation. A mere pittance if you consider it received a 96/100 on Distilled (my goto app for this stuff). Try to find another 90+ rating that costs less than $100.
