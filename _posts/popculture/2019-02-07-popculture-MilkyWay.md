Have you ever thought you didn't like something that upon later tasting, you learn that you actually love it?




That is me and Milky Way bars.


For those of you who don't know, a Milky Way bar is a cross between a Three Musketeers bar (with the chocolate mouse like stuff in the middle) and a Snickers (with the caramel, no nuts). Sounds good? Eh.

I remember as a wee lad the Milky Way fun size bars I got from Halloween were the first to be put to the side. The Twix, Reese's, M&M's, Snickers, Nestle Crunch, etc were all ahead of the Milky Way.


To be fair, the Milky Ways were eventually eaten, but not before all the other goodies I got. I mean it was not like I hated the Milky Way, but it was definitely a low tiered candy for me.


But not now!!!

I have discovered the Milky Way and now it a top tier bar for me. I love them and they are my current first choice from the vending machine at work. In fact, I am enjoying one now. 



Is a Milky Way for you? I am not sure. But this little tale of self-discovery should inspire you to revisit an old acquaintance that maybe wasn't a friend at first. Things change, you may be surprised.
