Does anyone still go to Burger King?


I mean you would think so. There are still many locations across America; possibly one near your home. 


But let me ask you this: when was the last time YOU went to Burger King? Better yet, when was the last time you knew anyone who went to Burger King?



I bet the answers to both of those questions is 'not in a loooong time'.




I don't think this is attributed to the health food craze. McDonalds and Subway have contoured their menus a tad to add in more healthy options, but there are still many fast food places doing well without changing much. Wendy's, Carl's Jr, Arby's, Taco Bell, etc are all doing well. Why not Burger King?



Well, when researching the top grossing fast food places in the US, Burger King is 5th, behind Wendy's, Subway, Starbucks, and McDonalds. So according to the interwebs, Burger King is doing OK. 

But how?

I feel Burger King is the NCIS of fast food; a highly successful franchise that lacks customers. Or at least customers that I know of. Or you know of as well. Have you ever met someone who has seen NCIS? Exactly.


The only explanation I have for the success of Burger King is that either my random sample of friends is barely missing the Burger King demographic or that my sample of friends is not so random and there is some latent trait in people that are not my friends that gravitate to the home of the Whopper. . 


Now I do not find enjoying Burger King a character flaw. I have enjoyed their brand of flame-boiled patties on more than one occasion. But that was like in the 80's and 90's. For some reason I don't think Burger King has evolved with the times. Other than still being a monarchy, their menu has always seemed like a ripped off and lesser version of their peers.


Anyway, I could be wrong, but next time you drive by a Burger King, count how many people are in there. 


I bet you can do that on one hand.
