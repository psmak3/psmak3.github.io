Oh my God!!!! I absolutely love Grumpy Cat. I mean I have always been a fan of funny cat memes; cats falling down, cats sleeping, cats scaring dogs, the material there is endless.

Every time I look at this feline, I laugh. I mean every-gosh darn-time I look, I laugh.

I cannot tell you how much I love this mouser of grump.



So I did some research. Apparently our four-legged curmudgeon (who's real name is Tardar Sauce) lives near Phoenix Arizona with Tabatha Bundesen.

Millions of dollars well deserved I may add.

For example:


What are my thoughts on fun?
