Worst Oscar year ever.


EVER!!!!


Black Panther for best picture? Has Hollywood white guilt finally hit the apex with this nominee? It is a good superhero movie, just because it has black people in it doesn't make it Best Picture.



Bohemeim Rhapsody? Even worse!!!! This is simply a fanboy propaganda film for 50 year old Queen fans. This is not even a good film. At all.



The Green Book? A buddy flick? God......



Roma will sweep everything, which is a good thing. A socially important film done properly by a very talented director saves the 2019 Oscars. 



That's all I have to say about this. 


Ugh.
