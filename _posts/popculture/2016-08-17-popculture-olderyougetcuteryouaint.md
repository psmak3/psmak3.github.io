We all liked silly things when we were kids. Whether it was a goofy toy or a favorite shirt, we all liked something that by today's standards looks sort of funny. 

This is to be expected, because....well....kids are dumb. But there are some things that age better than others.

For example, Sesame Street ages well. Granted, middle-aged men are not the target audience, but you can watch an episode and see that this is a quality show for kids. Mr. Roger's Neighborhood is another example of a good kids show. Yes, it looks a bit odd that he is changing clothes on air (you would think he would be more prepared), but the show holds up for kids.


But there are some shows that are just plain stupid. I mean not just stupid like we have grown out of it, but really really poor and shotty. And no one epitomizes low-quality children shows as much as Hanna-Barbera.

To start, look at the animation. It is just so cheap. I mean no one's jaw ever moves when talking. It is just so lame.

But even worse is the 'really deep and insightful' characters they created. Let's look at some of their best work:


- Huckleberry Hound

This is a dog who is blue, therefore he deemed a 'Huckleberry' of a hound. Oh yeah, he also has a slight southern accent. What does he do other than exist? Nothing.


- Yogi Bear

He is named after a Yankee's catcher, Yogi Berra. Really it was the 'Berra' part that had the biggest influence on choosing Yogi Berra to be the inspiration for this bear. So what does Yogi Bear do? Steals picnic baskets. That's it. He is hungry and he steals from others. Really cool character, huh?


- Great Gazoo

This guy was brought in when the writers of the Flintstones ran out of ideas. It is an alien that only Fred sees and grants him wishes. So you have this prehistoric world, IE: Bedrock,  where there were puns galore on rocks and caveman things, then all of the sudden there is an alien that haunts Fred's mind. Is it me or is that really really stupid.


- Scrappy Doo

God, did anyone like this guy? All Scrappy Doo wanted to do was fight. I guess he was 'Scrappy'. Good one Hanna and/or Barbera. I can't even find the words to describe how annoying this little terd was.


- Gleek

Yes, it is a monkey that was hanging around superheroes? Why? Fuck if I know. Gleek was essentially the pet of the Wonder Twins, who strangely enough had the most powerful superpowers of all (even more than Superman). They can literally turn into anything. However most of the time they turned into stupid shitty things like 'water' and 'bucket', or 'bird' and 'nest'. Never sure why they didn't turn into 'big monster' and 'even bigger monster' and just crush everyone. Regardless, for as lame and misplaced as the Wonder Twins are in the Hall of Justice, what the hell is a monkey doing there? God I hated Gleek.


- Grape Ape

There is nothing to say here. This is just so stupid I have to stop.

There are literally dozens more shitty characters in the Hanna-Barbera world. And you know why? It took them probably 15 seconds to create one of these bland cartoons. Hey, a penguin who is green...let's call him 'Green Penguin' and give him a New York accent. Oh I have an idea....a lion who is sad....let's call him 'Cryin' Lion' and give him a Scottish accent. Hey, how about an ape who is purple and call him Grape....oh nevermind, did that one last week.


The worst thing is that Hann-Barbera had their non-creative claws all over children's cartoons in the 70's and 80's. I couldn't avoid them!! Luckily for the next generation, this monopoly of banality was somewhat broken up and there emerged some competition. But damn...I really use that time back. 

Grape Ape? Grape fuckin' Ape? Seriously?
