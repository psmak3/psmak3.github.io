The world is changed.

I feel it in the water.

I fell it in the earth.

I smell it in the air.

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.



It began with the forging of a campaign. Three debates were given to the TV networks; lame, stupid exercises in bullying. Seven idiot promises to his fanbase, idiots who don't understand the way government works. And nine, nine insulting statements were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these 'gifts' was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another thing was made. Deep in the land of New York, in the Fires of Trump Tower, the Dark Lord Donald forged a master persona, and into this persona he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One Trump to rule them all.

Yes, Donald Trump paid a visit to north Seattle yesterday. I have no idea why he came. According to 538.com, he has a 6% chance of winning Washington, and it is not like he has unlimited time or funds for this trip.


He came here saying things such as:

- 'Our country is going to hell and we’re not going to let it happen'

- 'This is what I’m promising: an honest government, a thriving economy, a just society … and jobs, lots of jobs'


- 'I am the change agent, I’m fighting for you'


- 'Nobody has been hurt more than African-Americans. War-torn countries are safer than living in our inner cities. By a lot. It’s not even close.'


Not one of those statements are true. Especially the fact he said he is fighting for you. 


Anyway, Trump spread his lies to the PNW yesterday, and even though Seattle is as blue as a newborn boy's blanket, he packed the 10,000 seat arena in Everett filled with his orcs. 

This just goes to show there are suckers in every region.
