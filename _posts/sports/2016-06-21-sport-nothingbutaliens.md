*Hello and welcome to Alien Week at the Spew! In order to honor the opening of Independence Day 2, possibly the silliest, stupidest, guiltiest pleasure franchise in movie history, The Spew will have a week long dedication to all things alien.*

On Sunday, we witnessed sports history as LeBron James and those other guys, I think it was Cleveland, won the NBA title versus a team that won a ton of games in Golden St. 

My first reaction to this was 'How can this be?'. I have watched many hours of the NBA this season and saw a Golden St team that was way better than Cleveland, a Golden St offense that scored at will, and a LeBron who looked like a man who was past his prime. I would have bet the mortage Golden St would have won this series is 5.

So I was obviously wrong. But how can that be? I am never that absolutely wrong....well conditioning on the fact you don't count those other times that I was that absolutely wrong in the past. 


I have one explanation....................

LeBron is an alien.


Now before you scoff, let me be clear. He is obviously not an 'alien' alien. I mean he has reproduced with humans (have 3 kids), obviously has human features like a human body and human face,
