So how can you tell if you, or your friends, are just a casual football fan or a real die hard football junkie:


Their reaction to this game.



Here are some of the cues that will indicate if you are a casual fan:


- You paid closer to the commercials than the actual game

- If you commented or read other comments about the halftime show on social media

- You said the game was awful and boring yet loved last year's game.



This last bullet point is the key one: 'the game was awful and boring yet loved last year's game'



Last year's game was exactly the same as this years but flipped backwards. Last year there was no punts, no good defense, and was a one score game with less than 4 minutes left with the team behind having the ball. This year there were a lot of punts, no good offense, and a one score game with less than 4 minutes left with the team behind having the ball.



Yes, there were not many points, but there was just the same level of competitiveness and great plays; it just so happens there were on the defensive side this year. 


However the entire media narrative about this game was it was boring, awful, and maybe the worst Super Bowl ever. 


I guess they are casual fans as well.


No wonder the NFL changes every rule to benefit the offense. No wonder all the NFL does is hype their offensive players. Apparently even the media are just casual fans who do not appreciate the actual game of football; they just want points.



So maybe you are one of those people who just likes offense and equates quality play with yards. That is OK. I mean we all cannot be die hard in everything. But that also means you do not get to complain about the rules benefiting the offense or that the yards and scores are getting ridiculous during the regular season. Apparently that is what you want.


And you will get it. This was the lowest Super Bowl ratings in 12 years. So make no mistake the NFL will fix that. So yes, the casual fans will get their way and influence the sport more than any fan who actually cares about the game as a whole.


You just didn't get your way this year.
