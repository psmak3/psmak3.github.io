# 10. Loch Lomond

![](https://www.whiskyintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/LochLomondWhisky_logo_gold_500_sq.png)

To start off our top 10 list, let's journey to a very unusual distillery: Loch Lomond. This place is tucked in right between the line of demarcation between the Highlands and the Lowlands in Scotland. The rich, dirty, overripe fruit character (with a bit of sandalwood in there) of their bottlings make their taste distinct in the Scotch world, and the price for their wares is about as reasonable as you can find. However, what makes Loch Lomond really a unique place are their stills; they have aptly named 'Lomond' Stills that have the ability to produce different types of distillates. Without getting into the weeds of this, these stills have plates that govern the type of juice it is making, hence being a multi-faceted distillery. If you haven't tried them yet, give their 12 year old a go; only $30 in most markets....definitely worth it.


# 9. Ardbeg

How can any scotch list be complete without having at least one of the three beats of Islay on there. In this case, I chose Ardbeg (although I also love Laphroaig and Lagavulin). Their ashy, meaty, and erverso peaty character (with a little bit of sandalwood) makes this single malt not one for the faint of heart. At 55 ppms (for the not-peat initiated, that is a measure of peat in the distillate, and 55 is a lot), Ardbeg is a model of peat intensity. But what makes Ardbeg a slight cut above the other peat monsters on Islay is their price, availability, and quality of their core range. Their three big releases are all under $100, and each of these bottles are high octane flavor experiences that vary enough so you want to collect all three. 




# 8. Glen Scotia

Glen Scotia used to be the 'other Campbeltown' distillery for years, however in recent times, Glen Scotia has really upped their game. With new ownership and a new approach, these guys are producing some of the most interesting and high quality scotch out there. They even are generous in the single cask/independent bottle market; you can find some of their most expressive single casks that really let that distillery signature pop; orchard fruit, sandalwood, and laced with a hint of Campbeltown funk. 

# 7. Arran


![](https://www.whiskyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/arran-logo.jpg)

Located on the isle of Arran, Arran makes Arran scotch and labels the bottle 'Arran' to denote the fact the distillery is named Arran because it is on the isle of Arran. Wait... they changed their name to Lochranza this past year? OK, uh, regardless of their branding, Arran (or Lochranza) makes a seriously good malt. One of the newer kids on the block, Arran was built in 1994 and just recently has been knocking it out of the park with their thick, malty, gummy bear fruity character with hints of pepper and sandalwood. Their 10 year old recently won the inaugural Online Scotch Malt Whisky Award for Best Overall Whisky, and for good reason; natural color, non-chill filtered, bottled at 46%, and with a very reasonable price tag of ~$60. Their entire line is just getting better.

# 6. Bunnahabhain


![](https://whiskymag.com/shares/bunnahabhain_logo_2017.jpg)

And now for something different.....Bunnahabhain is the one distillery in Islay that does not peat their whisk most of the time (OK Bruichladdich doesn't either, but Port Charlotte does, and they are sort of the same place). Instead of peat, Bunnahabhain relies on the salty sea character of their distillate and sherry butts to bring home that unique Bunnahbahain character. Deep dark fruit tones, brine, dark chocolate notes, and with a skosh of sandalwood, Bunnahabhain will always be a favorite among whisky folk. But....when they do decide to peat their juice....watch out! You get another layer of complexity added to an already complex dram. 

# 5. Clynelish

![](https://spiritedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Clynelish.png)

Wax on, wax off, wax on again; that is the unofficial motto I just gave Clynelish. Located in the upper part of Scotland, Clynelish is one of the bell cows of Diageo (the sort of ECorp of Scotch). Clynelish is widely used by blenders to make blended whisky. Why is that? Well, first off they make a butt load of whisky per year. But also it is just one of those scotches that assimilate to other whisky so well without hijacking the dram. But guess what....it is even better on its own. Clynelish 14 is a sensational dram, filled with honey, citrus fruits, sandalwood, and WAX. Yes, wax. That waxy texture of Clynelish is their signature, and exists even more profoundly in indie bottles. If you haven't tried this one, do it now.     


# 4. Craigellachie



![](https://www.spiritofspeyside.com/site/assets/files/1944/craigellachie_whisky.654x0.jpg)


Maybe a bit of a surprise for some to see this distillery ranked so high, but I feel it is a oft overlooked whisky that should be talked about more. Dwelling in the scotch-populous region of Speyside, Craigellachie is a bit of a black sheep in those parts. Most of Speyside juice is light, fruity, and easy to drink. However, Craigellachie is a different animal. Sure, they bring the fresh orchard fruits tot he table. But Craigellachie also brings sulfur, funk, dirtiness, and a tiny wisps of sandalwood as well. Also, Craigellachie say 'be damned' to all of the typical age statements. Do they have a 12 year! No! The have a 13 year. How about an 18 year? No way Jose, they have a 17 year. And what about a 21 year? Stop with yourself, they have a 23 year old instead. Also they often populate the indie bottle market with very reasonable prices (because they are still a bit under the radar from my estimation), so Craigellachie really does check all the boxes.  


# 3. Kilchoman

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETQIh7yWAAAO1hW?format=jpg&name=medium)

I love peated whisky, so I can't simply have only one peat-forward distillery on here. So let's bring on another. Kilchoman is one of the most recent distilleries on the isle of Islay (circa 2004). Because they are so new, they don't have the same mature stock to pull from as their friends from Laphroaig or Lagavulin. But for what they lack in aged whisky they make up for in innovation and cask selection. They are a small independently owned distillery, which allows them to experiment with their stuff and not worry so much about mass distribution. They have tons of interesting stuff out there; sherried whisky, wine-aged whisky, STR cask whisky, and all sorts of combinations of those caskings. Even though their stock is low and don't partake in the indie bottle-verse, they are very generous with releasing cask strength bottles in all different varieties. Their peat is harsh, salty, and ashy. Their distillate balances the peat well with vanillas, creams, and a whisper of sandalwood. These guys are doing it right.

# 2. Balvenie


![](https://www.whiskyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/balvenie-logo.jpg)

The Balvenie 12 Doublewood is my gateway whisky. The Balvenie distillery is my first Scotch whisky tour. Balvenie is my wife's favorite distillery. So I will always be partial to this regardless. But it also turns out they make a damn fine bottle of Scotch. It is true that their mass produced 43% chill-filtered offerings can be a bit pedestrian for the connoisseur, but that is not all they do. Their single barrel 12-year ex bourbon and their 15 year sherried whiskys are rich, bold, juicy fruit-esque, and has a tinge of sandalwood; a far more representative look at what Balvenie is capable of. Their Week of Peat (a very peated affair...better than almost all Islay peated stuff for that matter) shows their versatility, despite being situated smack dab in the middle of Speyside country. Balvenie doesn't play the indie bottle game so it is very hard to find their whisky at cask strength, which is a damn shame and makes them frustrating at times. But as I said earlier, they are my first scotch love and I owe them quite a bit. 

# 1. Springbank

![](https://mark.abear.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Springbank-Logo.jpg)

This is not surprising to anyone that knows me. Springbank has been my favorite distillery ever since I laid my lips on a Springbank 10. This whisky is like nothing else out there. Not only does Springbank bottles cover the entire flavor wheel, they even introduce flavors that are too exotic and bizarre that one mere flavor wheel cannot contain: plastic, vulcanized rubber, industrial notes, and that trademark Springbank 'funk'. Springbank's lineup is also so diverse: want more sherry, buy a Springbank 15. Want more ex-bourbon, buy the 18. Want more power? Try the 12 year cask strength. Need some more peat? Go get a Longrow. Hate the peat? Hazelburn 10. Curious about different caskings? Longrow Red series, Springbank yearly releases, or Hazelburn yearly releases. Want some sandalwood? Yes, my friend, it is in every bottle they produce. What makes Springbank even more great is they are environmentally conscious, give back to their community, independently owned, never chill filter, all natural color, and are a true paradigm of integrity. The one issue is that...well...every whisky die-hard loves them as well, so the availability can be an issue, therefor the supply/demand curve can affect the pricings (not to Springbank's liking. They do NOT receive any extra money from the market mark-ups and they are trying to do something about that). But despite that frustration, there is no other distillery that captures what Scotch can be and should be.
