# 10. Halloween

Friday the 13th; a spooky time for all. Some people even stay home because of the pending doom that lies awaiting for them if they leave their house. So to capture this eerie and overall frightening day, I think Halloween is a good start. Yes, I know, this movie is probably more appropriate for Halloween. Because, well, the name is Halloween. Maybe that is why it is not higher on the list. But it is a good horror flick. It is also based on the true story of Michael Myers, who killed people then made Wayne's World. Very chilling indeed.  
 
 
 
 
# 9. Cabin in the Woods

Now I have never seen this movie, but I heard it was good. I really haven't seen many horror films (personally the genre is silly to me) so I needed to fill out this list somehow. If you want to get freaked out on the 13th and have a few laughs, this movie will do the trick. Or at least I think so. Or so I've been told. Or whatever. Just watch it. And tell me about it later.


# 8. Saw

I have actually seen this one, and it's pretty damn good. It has a nice eerie feel to it, a lot of mystery, and I can honestly say I did NOT expect the ending. Also, unlike the subsequent Saw movies, this one builds suspense and tension with cleverness and not just with simple unabashed gore or disgusting situations. 

# 7. Love Actually

There is nothing more frightening to me than people thinking this movie is good. It is simply awful in every single way. The characters are all idiots, the situations are completely moronic, and it is overall one of the stupidest films I have ever seen. Ever!! The fact this movie has a following scares the living hell out of me. And every time I see bits and pieces of it, I am reminded of that.



# 6. Freaks

If you are a horror movie aficionado, you have to see Freaks. The premise in itself is not terrifying; just a bunch of circus freaks wandering around on camera. But the thing is that they are real freaks. REAL FREAKS! I know, huh. It is really weird seeing this. And seeing them try to act is also very off-putting. This entire film makes me uneasy, from beginning to end. In fact, I don't even remember what it is about; think there is some love story in there or something. But I will not forget the feeling this movie gives me. There is no substitution for authenticity. 


# 5. Texas Chainsaw Massacre

I saw this movie for the first time at a local theater here in Seattle about 3 years ago. I thought it was just going to be a simple B slasher movie that is forgettable. Boy was I wrong. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is completely unforgettable. Credited for being the first of its kind, this movie is super creepy from beginning to end. The grainy picture quality, the uneven acting, and the sheer madness of the entire situation, Texas Chainsaw Massacre entertains and surprises you at every turn. Even though since this film there have been tons of slasher films, none match the unearthly quality of this guy. 

# 4. Nightmare on Elm Street

When I was a kid, I loved Freddy Kruger. I mean who wouldn't? Pedophile janitor of an elementary school who was burned to death by the parents who now haunts the dreams of teenagers....what's not to like? Anyway, Freddy is a great character. His well-defined look (hat and sweater), his weapon of choice (razor blade hands, that is pretty cool), his wisecracking dialogue, Freddy is an iconic figure in the horror genre. And to be fair, the first movie in the series is pretty good. But even though the series quickly becomes very schlocky after Wes Craven's first installment, the character of Freddy maintains intriguing. 


# 3. Evil Dead 2

Now here is a movie perfect for the 13th. Is there anything more insane, campy, self-aware, and all around fun than the Evil Dead series? I mean the fact that Bruce Campbell has not received an Oscar nod is criminal to me. Even though all the movies that Sam Raimi touched with his Evil Dead magic are good, we all can agree his magnum opus in this franchise is Evil Dead 2. From beginning to end, this movie does not stop with the fun; I mean needless gore AND goofy acting? Yes please.



# 2. Friday the 13th

How can I make a 'Movies for Friday the 13th' list without including a movie actually named Friday the 13th? Well, I can't. Now don't get me wrong, this movie is terrible. The original one released in 1980 is the best of the lot, but that is like saying you are the world's tallest midget. The original premise is that boy (Jason) drowned at camp and the mother became a serial killer on the campgrounds for years. Then 7 sequels later, Jason is in space murdering people. Go figure. Yes, this movie sucks, and not the 'so bad it's good' way. No, it just sucks. It is slow, the acting is bad, the writing is lame, and there is zero tension throughout the film. But again, this is a list about the most appropriate movies for Friday the 13th, so by default it had to rank high.



# 1. Lord of the Rings

What else? This movie is the best for ALL occasions. Need I say more?
