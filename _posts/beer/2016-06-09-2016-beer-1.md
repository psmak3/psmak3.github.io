Summer is right around the corner and things are heating up! In fact here in Seattle it was 90 degrees Celsius on Sunday! Oh wait...it was Fahrenheit. Anyway, it is still hot for a city with no AC.

So what a better way to cool down than with a nice Hefeweizen or a Pale Ale? Well, I'll tell you, a tasty hoppy IPA!!! Those other types are for sissies.


The PNW is well known for their craft IPA's; a piney and hoppy ale with a slight touch of citrus, there is no doubt that not only has Seattle craft breweries specialize in creating new IPA's, this is the style of choice for the locals.

So here are five reviews of IPA's (in no particular order). There will be many more IPA reviews to come, so don't worry 'fans of the hop', there is a vast reservoir of beers to judge.


# 1. Hale's Ale - Supergoose IPA

## 7.1% ABV 72 IBU

Hale's is not Seattle's favorite craft brewery at all. In fact I would say most of their stuff is blase. However.....this is an excellent IPA. It has a hint of citrus without being too sweet, and the hops punch you in the mouth without leaving an awful aftertaste. This is my go-to IPA and lucky for me I can find it often here in Seattle. For every Mariner pre-game, you can find me downing a few of these Superb Geese before the first pitch.

### Rating: 4/5

# 2. Cloudburst - Hotline Bling IPA

## 6.7% ABV 68 IBU

Cloudburst is a new brewery here in Seattle; an off shoot of the very popular Elysian craft brewery. They make really good stuff, but this one is not there best. It is light and fluffy, like a dog that sheds on your new black shirt. It is cute, but nothing that makes it step up.

### Rating: 3/5

# 3. Boneyard - Hop Venom IPA

## 9% ABV 60 IBU

Here we go! Now we are talking. If Hotline Bling was the cute fluffy dog, this one is Cujo. It attacks your palette with a nice mix of hops. And don't forget about that 9%...get an Uber because you should not be driving home after a few of these. Nice work Bend, Oregon, for being a such a little city, you make great beer. 

### Rating: 4/5


# 4. Elysian - Space Dust IPA

## 8.2% ABV 73 IBU

You can't write reviews on beer without including Elysian. Some say they sold out to Budweiser, some like other more 'indie' breweries here in town, but there is no doubt Elysian makes a good brew. They are not afraid to experiment and try new cool things. This one is a standard, and I would say their best IPA offering. 73 IBU is quite bitter, so check your poker face at the door because your mug will squirm a bit. 


### Rating: 3.5/5


# 5. Backwoods - Double Cutt IIPA

## 8.5% ABV 65 IBU

This is maybe the best IPA I have ever had. Maybe because it is a double! Not only is the 8.5% hits you like a ton of feathers (which is the same weight as a ton of bricks, so I am sure that would render some damage), it is as smooth as the pillow case holding the aforementioned ton of feathers. It is very piney, so beware. But it is the type of beer that you don't get tired of. 

## Rating: 5/5
