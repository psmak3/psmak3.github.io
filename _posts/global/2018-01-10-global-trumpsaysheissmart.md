Last week, 'Fire and Fury', the hottest book on the market right now, was released. And boy did it have some.....say....things in it.



I won't recount all the dirt that is in it about the president, the dysfunction, and the insanity that is going on behind closed doors (and slightly ajar doors as well), but the main message from all the candid interviews with White House staffers is that Donald Trump is childish, uninterested, and stupid.



I have thought Trump is an idiot for a long time. I mean everyone who ever reads any of my musings knows this already. 

But apparently I am wrong.



As a rebuttal to 'Fire and Fury', Donald Trump tweeted these two points:


'Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart. Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames.'



'I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star to President of the United States (on my first try). I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius....and a very stable genius at that!'




I don't know about you, but I'm convinced. 


I mean most people who are like, really smart, say that they are...like...really smart....all the time. Remember when Enrico Fermi classically stated 'I know about physics because I am like really smart'. Or the time when Nikola Tesla famously declared 'I have done a lot of interesting things with electricity, so that makes me like really smart'. 


Of course those men are like really smart! They just said so! Who the hell are you to disagree with those like really smart people?


As far being mentally stable, well, only the most sane of people label themselves as stable. From what I understand, the first question psychiatrists as patients is 'are you stable?'. If they say 'yes', they are free to go. I think that when Charles Manson was questioned about the Helter Skeltor murders in the 70's, the police asked him if he was stable. When he said 'no', that was the big crack in the case. 


Simply put, when people insist they are something outwardly in a braggadocios way, like being smart, good at sports, heterosexual, etc...... well shit! Of course they are all of those things!! I mean not only they said they are all of those things, they said it a lot. Remember that kid in elementary school who said they had all the toys, was the best at basketball, and had so many friends? That kid was AWESOME!!! Everyone wanted to be that kid's friend.



So Donald Trump, I am sorry. I did not realize you were so like, smart, and is a stable genius. I mean if you are not those things, why would you say it?
