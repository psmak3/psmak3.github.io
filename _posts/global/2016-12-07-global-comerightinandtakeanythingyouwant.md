In the constant evolution of how our society is purchasing goods, Amazon (the vanguard of new ways of shopping) is piloting a brand new way you can get stuff; by letting you walk in a brick-and-mortar store and take anything you want.




Seems like a terrible business model on the surface. I mean these are the guys that had 30% of all online sales for Back Friday and Cyber Monday. Yes....30% of ALL online sales. They have to be doing something right.


Well, there is a catch: you have to pay for the stuff you take.

But how will they know who took what?


Well, there in lies the rub. The preliminary idea is that you check in using your Amazon account, take whatever the hell you want, and when you leave your Amazon app somehow knows what stuff you took.


So no lines, no fuss, no muss, no issues.


Well, we will see. The first one of these stores is right next door to me here in little ole' Seattle. In fact it is literally 5 blocks away from where I am typing this. For now, this pilot store is only open to Amazon employees (I guess there has to be some benefit for working 60+ hours a week there for a despot boss like Bezos), but soon maybe the likes me will be able to go in and scout the terrain.


There is obviously a lot of questions on how this will actually work and whether it is a good idea to let people (who as we all know are sort of bad with money, reference the housing market of 2000-2006) take things and not have that feeling of actually buying their stuff. It will be interesting to see how this plays out, but I for one cannot wait to go in this store, grab a bunch of stuff I don't need, leave, and get a bill at the end of the month that will horrify me.
