Finally!!!

Finally!!!

FINALLY!!!



Finally scientiest are doing something worthwhile.


A global team of scientics are going to search for the existence of the Loch Ness Monster using advanced environmental DNA techniques. 


Pay no matter to the fact that such a huge animal in a very closed environment can live for literally decades without being detected.

Pay no matter to the fact that any animal in a very closed environment can live for literally decades without being detected.

Pay no mind to the fact that the way life survives is to populate and grow, hence having more critters than before.


Pay no attention to the fact that an animal with that much size would need to constantly be eating, ergo the biome it is currently be living in would leave huge traces of it's existence.


Oh yeah, and all those photos of it have been proven to be a hoax.


Well, maybe with the expection of this one:

I am sure this is a great use of resources and hopefully we can get closer to the long and oft-asked existential question of Nessie; is it a hoax that only people ignorant of how life works believe in or is there a big fat monster living in a lake for millions of years that has been narrowly missed being noticed for hundreds of years?



Only science can answer that question.
