Millennials get a bad wrap. They are weak, selfish, little snowflakes that need to be nurtured and are naive to the harshness of the real world.


I am not sure if that is fair, I mean I am sure there are may Millennials that are not soft. I mean how accurate are stereotypes anyway.



Well, in some cases they are.


Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the new young NY representative that is the media darling of all liberal channels, is this classic stereotypical Millennial.



After bursting on the public stage out of nowhere, beating the incumbent in the primaries and winning the general easily with her socialist rhetoric, Ocasio-Cortez has been the belle of the ball. All the progressives were getting on board with her bandwagon and even some peeps of dethroning Nancy Pelosi were surfacing when Ocasio-Cortez and friends saw they were taking the House.


Then reality happened.

Other than the new young aggressive progressive types exposed their complete naivete when they reneged on their ire towards Pelosi and (rightfully) placed her back on her perch (you need strength to fight idiots like Trump, not newbie idealist who don't know how the system really works), we now see Ocasio-Cortez for what she is; a snowflake.



Right before Ocasio-Cortez has to journey to DC to start doing her duty, she has announced she is taking a timeout for 'self-care'. She has said that during this time between the election and now, she has neglected herself and needs to finds herself again (since she cannot do yoga as much anymore :( ). Ocasio-Cortez has been quoting self-care books and other pop-psychology outlets to justify this time off.



Yeahhhhhhh.




This is your typical snowflake who claims to be soooo caring and soooo giving, yet when it comes down to true sacrifice, those people show their true colors become suddenly selfish.


To be fair, it may not be so much as being a part of this particular generation or just the fact that it really is a function of youth. Whichever it is, it is time for people to appreciate experience and true toughness and selfishness and stop rewarding these politicians who claim to be caring and energetic yet are just naive and self-absorbed with our attention and votes. Alexander Ocasio-Cortez is a fraud. She is a young idealist who loves the attention yet really doesn't know how to do this job properly because she DOESN'T KNOW ANTHING!


Hmmm, sounds like a certain other person in high office.
