Yes people, look who is back. It is everyone's favorite Mormon Mittens 'Mitt' Romney!!



You may think being an also-ran in the GOP primaries in 2008 would keep him down. You may think losing the presidential race in 2012 would defeat him. You may even think not getting the Secretary of State job in 2016 would be the end for one Mitt Romney. 


But no!!!! You can't simply defeat a man like Mitt so easily. Don't be such a fool. 




In fact, Mitt may win his first race in over 10 years. The former senior senator from Utah, 'Borin' Orrin Hatch, is quitting because...well....he sold his soul to Satan and Satan wants his just dues. And who is going to replace ole' Orrin? You guessed it! The Mitten man himself.


Now you may ask yourself, 'hey there, wait a second. I thought Romney was the governor of Massachusetts, why does he get to run for senator in Utah?'. Well, he changed his hometown on Twitter yesterday from 'Massachusetts' to 'Utah', so there you go.



Anyway, I always sort of like the Mitt. Not to say I would vote for him (a bit too buddy-buddy with the wealthy for my taste). but he did some admirable things as governor. He installed a heath care system, he boosted the local economy, and was more of a middle-of-the-road guy when it came to social issues. Also he is not such a bad guy. Maybe a bit wooden, but so was Gregory Peck, and that guy got to date Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday. 


But most importantly for today, he has been a huge criticizer of Trump ever since the Donald was getting momentum in early 2016. Mitt never did pull his mitts back when it came to roasting Trump, and that is exactly what this country needs right now; more GOP standing up to Trump and stop being such cowards.


Now I grant you that Mitt has not had the best record of staying true to his word. In 2012, much of his beliefs as a governor he softened on to fit more with the GOP platform. So yes, he has that 'anything for power' element in him. Also he has more money than God, so he is pretty out of touch with the hoi polloi.


But this is a step in the right direction for this country. I do not expect the Mitt to vote blue on any issue, but at least there will be one more voice on the right side of the aisle to combat Trump and his autocratic and treasonous ways.


At least I hope so.
