As we all know, the oddly popular revival of Roseanne has been canceled due to a twitter rant by their star, Roseanne Barr. 


Looking back at the entire thing, I should not be shocked on the reason why Roseanne was canceled, although at first I was. I thought for sure the reasons would have more to do with not being funny or the fact that dusting off old sitcom ideas just seemingly should not work. But it did. Sort of.


Anyway, we all should have known the way this ship would sink is by a racist twitter rant. Other than the fact that Roseanne Barr has had a recent history (albeit a less publicized history) of saying things one should not say on Twitter, the show Roseanne is a picture of Trump support, and the main arm of this support is grounded in racism.



Not just a section of the support; almost all of it.



We all keep wondering what is the appeal of Trump? I mean he is rude, overtly stupid, and has no concern for anyone outside himself. All of these traits are showcased on literally a daily basis. So why would anyone support him?


Well look no farther than Breitbart News; the seedy underbelly of American news culture. Yes, I read it almost every day, and NOT for the articles. But to learn what stories Breitbart finds important, how they manipulate the Trump base, and for how this base reacts to these stories via the comments section.

To give you an idea on how this Roseanne story is reacted to by Trump's base, here is some perspective:


The average story on Breitbart is about one of three things: immigration crime, the corruption and demise of Hollywood, and general political news. The general news usually elicits about 500-800 comments, immigration crime about 1500, and Hollywood stuff around 1000. This Roseanne story aroused 25,000 comments in less than 10 minutes! Yes, that much. And what is the voice? Almost in unison, Roseanne was wronged and the PC world run by the liberal media elites are destroying the culture.


Now I won't get into the mentality of this too much, there are far more qualified people that have done this far better than I can that I have seen on TV; ideas about nostalgia, racism, being a victim of today's society, etc. 

But there is one thing that I will emphasize; Trump's base hates non-white people.

It is not economics. Sure, they are mad about lack of pay raises, but with no proof that is blamed on immigrants. 

It is not crime. Yeah, they believe that black people, Muslims, and immigrants are out to get them. But how many have actually been a victim of a crime from an illegal alien? 

It is not global issues. These people cannot understand the complexity of this, all they feel is that Obama was wrong and the opposite is right.


Every issue that has been said to be important for this base is, at it's root, shrouded in racism. Trump symbolizes their feelings on this issue. Why is it that every time Trump softens on immigration, the base goes crazy and Trump immediately returns to his hardline stances? Why else does his base react 20x more to a comment from a washed-up comedian than they do about any economic decision levied against their tax bracket? 20 times more!!! 


By all rational thought, this Roseanne thing is just a minor blip in the landscape of pop culture life. No more or less than the time she sang the National Anthem, butchered it, and spit on the ground while grabbing her crotch (something that I wonder if Trump's base can ever forgive an NFL player doing). But the fact that this is the #1 story in their eyes shows what these people really find important. It is not the show they want protected. It is not Roseanne they want protected. It is not even their jobs they want protected. What they want is their racist ideas to be protected. And nurtured. And cultivated. And to become the main ideology of America once again.

'Make America Great Again'.........that is what it really means to them.
