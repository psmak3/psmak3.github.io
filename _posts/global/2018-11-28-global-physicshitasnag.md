I've an article recently that the world of physics has hit a wall and there have been hardly any new discoveries. 

This is mainly in the field of astronomy, where there was some expectation for advancement based on the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in Switzerland. In other words, the theoretical part is not matching with the empirical data gathered at the LHC. Now on the macro level, we are discovering tons of exoplanets, even inhabitable ones, but we don't gain more knowledge about these planets other than the fact that they exist and if they are gas giants or terrestrial orbs. Why? Well, these planets are so damn far away, we will never get there before we know how to fold space-time.  


So what does this mean? Well, other than this creating tons of frustration in the community and the feeling of wasting a lot of money on null results, this means one thing:

We as humans are barking up the wrong tree. All of this is due to God.


Yes, God. The big man upstairs. You know, the guy who created the heavens and Earth in the amazingly efficient 6 day time span. Why even bother with atoms bashing into each other trying to re-create the Big Bang? Why even bother looking at other planets out there? Why do any of this when it was all God who did this stuff. 


And how do we know this? Well, ever heard of a little book called........the BIBLE!!!! Yes, the highest selling book in history answers all of these creation questions in the very front. In only like 2 pages too. Don't these scientists ever read? 



So there is no need to throw billions of dollars at this problem. There is no need to 'collect data' or use 'logical reasoning'. Just read the first few pages of the Bible and you get all that you need.


Moral of the story: if the question is too hard to answer, just give up and say God did it. 

Or aliens. That can work as well.
