Hearing about Trump's proclivity for prostitutes in not surprising at all. Heck, I would be far more shocked if no porn stars at all came out of the woodwork accounting their 'relationship' with the thousand-dollar playboy of New Jersey. In other words, the Stormy Daniels saga doesn't surprise me at all, and also will fail to move the needle of public opinion at all.


However there is something that surprised me recently.

Karen McDougal, the ex-Playmate who has come out recently saying she had an affair with Trump while his wife was pregnant, has been quoted as saying:


"After we had been intimate, he tried to pay me, and I actually didn't know how to take that. I don't even know how to describe the look on my face. It must have been so sad. That's not me. I'm not that kind of girl."



Say what?



You mean that you are not the kind of girl that takes money for sex, but you are the type of girl that will have sex with Trump voluntarily, with no money exchanging hands? 


You mean that you saw that fat, bloated, orange, balding, mean-spirited, and incredibility stupid man as someone you would like to get to know more, maybe go out a few times, and have a magical evening in bed together? Why in the hell did you have sex him? For love? You think that all of this means you hold the higher moral ground over a prostitute? Yeah, probably not.

A prostitute is not a morally corrupt person necessarily. Illegality aside, they are essentially just small business owners who perceive sex in a different way than many in this Puritanical nation. I am not arguing that prostitution should or should not be legal, but being a prostitute is really not the worst thing in the world.

Now having sex with Donald Trump and NOT expecting financial compensation and brag about it later....well....now you are getting close to the worst.



So Karen McDougal, you maybe are not that type of girl who has sex for money. But you also may be mentally ill. Next time, take the money and hire a good psychiatrist.
