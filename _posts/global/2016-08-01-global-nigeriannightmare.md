BBC reported today that a top internet scam artist was caught today by Interpol. The man (it's always a man, huh) only known as 'Mike' was running internet scams all over the world, netting a profit of around $60 million.


And guess where he was caught?


Nigeria.



The first thing I thought when I read this was 'Holy shit! Does this mean my money reached the besieged Nigeria prince?'.


Other questions were soon arising:

- What is going to happen to all of those beautiful Russian women? All they need is a nice man to help usher them out of their cold and miserable life. Is Svetlana never coming to Seattle to meet me?

- Am I never going to receive my free vacation to Australia? I mean I gave 'Super Fun Like Travel' Company my credit card number. I hope they don't forget about me.

- When in the world is that penis cream coming? All of men can use an extra 3 inches.


Is it possible that all of my internet dealings over the years have been a sham? I mean I am no fool. I know when a deal is too good to be true. My nickname in college was 'the Big Stupid Fuckin' Idiot' because I so wasn't that. I assumed it was one of those ironic nicknames like Little John or Touchdown Tommy Vardell. 


Anyway, you have to wake up really early in the morning to get one past me. I mean there is no way all of those emails I responded to (most sent with 'Urgent' as the title, people don't throw that term around unless the situation is urgent) were scams. Right?


So I read on in great fear....... 

Phew! It turns out this 'Michael' guy just scammed small businesses with phony messages involving bank payments and tricking them to handing out their account numbers. How stupid are those suckers? I mean it is so obviously a ruse; banks. Hah!! Stupid morons.


So it looks like that Nigerian prince will still receive my generous donation. I really hope so. Everyone needs some help at times, even nobility. I just wonder if Mr. Abacha can someday retrieve the funds that are rightfully his.....
