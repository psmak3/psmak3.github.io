You have to love Donald Trump. 



I haven't commented on him for about 2 weeks and this is what happened during that time:

- He asks Russia for help to find Hillary's missing emails

- He implies that second amendment supports should have a call to arms against Hillary

- He continues to bash the Khan family

- He says Obama 'literally' founded ISIS

- The next day he said he was sarcastic about that

- That very day, he said he wasn't really sarcastic

- He unveils a tax plan that is very dangerous to the middle class and very beneficial to the upper class (only Gary Johnson's plan is worse...but to be fair it is FAR worse [read this before you fall in love with a thrid party guy](https://www.thestreet.com/story/13612038/1/if-libertarian-gary-johnson-was-president-here-rsquo-s-what-would-happen-to-the-u-s-economy.html))

- He said 'titties' instead of 'cities' after talking about appointing his daughter to be a head of a council

- He is trying to coin the phrase 'extreme vetting', which no one, including Trump, has yet developed a definition for


I probably even missed a few, but regardless that is a fountain of material.


I never watched 'The Apprentice' due to the fact reality TV is all around awful. However if it was half as entertaining as Trump's campaign, then I may have to go back and see a few.

Witnessing his campaign and his unbridled idiocy is like watching the birth of a farm animal: gross, disgusting, and feels like something that humans should not gawk at, yet you have to because it is so bizarre and alien to anything we have ever seen before.

I don't know what is funnier: seeing Trump shit on himself on a daily basis or seeing the Republican support still trying to salvage this sinking ship. Some have safely pulled a Billy Zane in Titanic and shoved off the women and children from the life boats to make way for themselves. But some are pulling a DiCaprio and are going to die in the frozen water of Trump's inanity.

So with that in mind, next week I will have a guest commentator that loves to defend Trump; my arch-nemesis the 'Tacoma Tirade'. Stay tuned next week to hear what he has to say. It is bound to be hilarious.
