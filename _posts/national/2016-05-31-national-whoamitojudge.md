I'll make this short: how is the replacement for Scalia a talking point for the presidential race? This should be the sitting president's decision, not anyone elses.


Yes, I have heard the other side saying things like 'in an election year, a second term president should not get to nominate anyone' or 'this is unpresidented, a president in his final year to nominate a justice'. 

Well, I call shenanigans on all of that!!


Quick facts:

- 1/3 of all US presidents appointed a Supreme Court Justice in an election year. [PROOF!](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/02/29/one-third-of-all-u-s-presidents-appointed-a-supreme-court-justice-in-an-election-year/)

- The last 3 'lame duck' presidents (by losing an election or exhaust their term) made nominees. [Actually read this article, this explains things way better than I ever can](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/14/marco-rubio/do-presidents-stop-nominating-judges-final-year/) 

So why doesn't Obama get to do the same thing every other president since 1900 get to do? I am not sure if their hatred for Obama by Republicans runs so deep or if the GOP still can't get over the fact there is a black president, but spreading these lies such as:

"There comes a point in the last year of the president, especially in their second term, where you stop nominating" both Supreme Court justices and Court of Appeals judges." - Marco Rubio, resident also-ran to Trump

is poisonous. We all have lives in this world and we don't focus all our attention on what the going-ons are in DC, so we rely on the politicians for some insight. These are just lies, and I think this is a bigger deal than the media has made it up to be.

Just let the president do his damn job and stop lying to me!!
