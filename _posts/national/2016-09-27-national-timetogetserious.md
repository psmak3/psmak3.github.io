OK, the joke is over. The time has come to inject some seriousness into all of this silliness. 

Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States. He is not qualified. He is not smart. He never tells the truth. He is a fundamentally malicious person who only loves himself. If you did not believe that going into Monday before the debate, then surely you do now.



If you are still on the fence, or better yet a fan of Trump, well, I don't know what to say to you. 

There are three types of 'baskets' that you could be in:

The think it is fair to say that each basket has an equal distribution of supporters. 


- You are a bigot or hate women. We see these people on Trump's main mouthpiece Breitbart.com. If you don't see this as a mirror reflecting hatred, please [click here and read the 'comments' section.](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/29/muslim-reformer-mohammad-viewed-violent-terrorist/)

- You are a sucker who has no idea how government works and really believe that Trump has the power as president to do the things he says (or you believe anything he says). These constitute the blue-collar worker who believes it is their divine right to have the same job their entire life, despite it being phased out by technological advances. These people are no friend of science and see educated folk as a threat to their lifestyle. They want the 50's back, yet they all have cell phones and benefit from medical discoveries. 

- You have so much brand loyalty to the 'R' by someone's name, you cannot see past that. These are the rank-and-file of the GOP that are blindly defending their candidate. Party over country. I think these people are the worst of the three. OK, they are not worst. But they are the most frustrating. They try not to own the bigotry and anti-logic of the alt-right movement yet still defend it. 'All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.' (Edmund Burke). 


Anyway, it is time to put a stop to this. It is getting worse and worse everyday. We liberals are so in tune with trying to understand the other side and being wishy-washy in the process. No more. 

A vote for Trump is NOT a vote against Clinton. OK, in an indirect way it is, but that is not a valid primary reason. That is easy chickenshit talk that is somehow supposed to absolve you of responsibility of your vote. A vote for Trump is FOR Trump. That says you WANT him to be president. Before you vote for him, do some research on him. Please. I mean actual unbiased research on him. Then defend.
