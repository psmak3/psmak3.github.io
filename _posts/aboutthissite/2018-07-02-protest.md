I am so fed up with this country, I cannot in good conscious celebrate the 4th of July knowing how much cancer there is in this land that I happen to live in.



So this year I will be protesting this holiday. So what does that mean.

Well.....


First off, I will NOT be updating my blog this week.


Secondly, I will NOT be going in to work Wednesday.


Thirdly, I will NOT be watching fireworks.


Fourth, I will only watch BBC/English born TV.


Finally, I will drink scotch, NOT American whiskey of any sort.


I know, this sounds rather harsh, but these are very troubling times. A country is only as good as its people and its leaders. What does this country value? I am not sure exactly, but I know it is not what I do.
