Sorry for the radio silence my friends, but I have been out of town over the past week and half in Tucson.

I was there:

- Visiting my mom

- Set up her brand new huge 4K TV (with new TV base)

- Seeing old friends

- Playing football in the street at a level unbeknownst to man

- Went to 2 UA basketball games (spoiler alert....that are really really good)



- Watching Power of the Dog (more on this in a later post)


- Just relaxing


But now I am back. Back to work, back to real life, back to writing this blog.


Until next week....when I go to Boston. Why Boston? Well, there are a lot of idiot fans there that need a good lecture. More on that to come.................
