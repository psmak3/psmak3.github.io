In response to the grief that has been given to me about the neglect of the 'Beer' category (and rightfully so) as well as the sparce entries of the 'Top 10', here is the new formatting information for all my readers:


1. Instead of updating each section twice a week, each will be updated once a week:
  Monday - Global/Personal
  Tuesday - National/Sports
  Wednesday - Local/Pop Culture
  
2. Beer and Top 10's will replace the updates of the other categories:
  Thursday - 5 beer reviews
  Friday - A new Top 10 list
  
3. Hopefully by the end of this week, I will add a 'Comments' section. This will be a general comments section and not attached to any particular post, however comments about anything in particular will be welcome (assuming it is phrased in a lauditory fashion)
