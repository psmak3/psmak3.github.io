Jeez! What a strange stretch for me.


First in Denver, now I have a friend visiting for the rest of the week.


Then next week, in San Jose for a conference!!


Wow! I feel so important now.


Anyway, I can't write much this week and only a few things next week (I'll close out my subject matters on Monday and Tuesday) but will return 100% the week after.


Or at least that's the plan. Unless something else pops up..............hmmmmmmmmmmmm
