Sorry I haven't been updating last week or this week. But there was a huge snow storm that hit the city and I could not work on it for half the week. The other half was used to catch up on work from the office.


This week......well, President's Day left Monday out and I am still trying to catch up with office duties.



But next week, I am sure to be back!!!




Unless it snows again......................
