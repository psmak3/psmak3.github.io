I can't write anything this week!!! I regrettably signed up for an all-week seminar (8 hours a day!) to get better at....whatever I do.


It sounded good at the time, but now...well..., not so much.



Wish me luck as I delve into the seas of academic boredom; hopefully I'll come out all the wiser on the other side. 

Or at least thankful that I don't ahve to go back for another year.
