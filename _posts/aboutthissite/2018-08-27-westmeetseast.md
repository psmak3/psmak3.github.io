YES!!! West Coast meets East Coast this week as I will be making my maiden voyage to New York City; land of the pretentious and the self-absorbed. 

Can I, as a life-long West Coaster, endure this culture shock? 

Will I be able to assimilate with the natives and extend the perverbial olive branch? And will said branch of olive be accepted?


Or will I just take a big dump on myself and wallow in the corner of the street in the fetal position for the week?



We will soon find out. Stay tuned........................
