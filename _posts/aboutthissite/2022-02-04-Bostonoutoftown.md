Yes, my friends, I was out of town once again. What a terrible start to the reopening of this blog, huh? Hopefully this coming month I will be way more consistent delivering the high-quality content you expect on a semi-daily basis. 

Yes, more Spew to come, I promise!

This time I was in the Northeast side of America; mainly Connecticut and Boston. And trust me, there is a lot that needs to be said about these areas.


I will save that for next week.

So until then....
