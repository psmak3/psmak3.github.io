This week I'll be going to Nashville and Kentucky. Now why in world would I go into this region; an area where they have a government-funded Noah's Ark exhibit? 


One word: whiskey.


Yes, my friend. Kentucky is the center of all American whiskey. Tons of distilleries, tons of bourbon!! Jim Beam, Bulleit, Maker's Mark, Old Forester, Buffalo Trace, just to name a few. I want to see what they got there.

And Nashville....well....other than being a hot spot for tourism, there is a world whiskey-fest there. Yes!! A world whiskey-fest, which means scotch will be part of the game. And with my VIP pass, I will be enjoying some serious stuff.


So when I return next week, you will here about some of this.


Or I'll just rail on about Kavanaugh or the NBA. 

Find out next week.
