This week marks the 1 year anniversary of Seattlespew.com!!!! 




Yes, for a year I have been posting my musings everyday (well, almost everyday) on all topics that are relevant, or should be relevant, to you and your world.


People ask me all the time, 'Where do you get all of your ideas? I mean you have posted over 300 things on this dumb site. This is a lot of material. What the hell is wrong with you?'.



Well, I have a lot of free time.



Anyway, I want to thank you the reader for enduring, and hopefully enjoying, the smatterings I spew out on this site on a daily basis. Even if you don't read every day, which I am sure most don't, I still want to thank you for your continued interest in the Spew.




Relatively soon, I plan on trying to reach a greater audience and post things on Medium.com. I have been planning on doing this for quite some time, but need to:

1) Select my best posts to upload on there to incite interest.

2) clean up some of the grammar/sentence flow so I don't sound like a moron.


Regardless, I plan on filling this site with the same high level of content and ideas that have made this site voted the '2nd most talented, most interesting, most extraordinary site in the universe written by a guy from Tucson and lives in Seattle' by Emmett Brickowski. (Damn you, AZ2WA.org!!!)




So read on MacDuff!!! There is still is much to say..............
