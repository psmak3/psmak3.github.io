So I took another week off. Lazy, I know. 

But there was a god reason for it: new computer.


You see, when I got my new computer on Tuesday last week, I had to set up all of these things on the new computer in order to do work. And the hardest things to set up.............syncing this site with my computer.


But I think I finally figured it out!!



So well will find out this week if that is the case.
