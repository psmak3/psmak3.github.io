I will be taking a break from the Spew this to.....uhhhh....honor our vets. Yeah....that.


Because as far as I am concerned, one random Monday in May is NOT ENOUGH to honor our brave men and women (mostly men) that have died to protect our way of life!! 


But one week is enough.


See ya in June........
