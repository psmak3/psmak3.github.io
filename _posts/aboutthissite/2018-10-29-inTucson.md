This week I will be in Tucson to help celebrate my parent's 50th wedding anniverary! 


Wow, 50 years, huh. That is a long time. Hell, I get tired of people after 2 weeks, much less 50 years. Truly a test of tolerance, patience, and stability.



Anyway, I'll be gone again this week from the Spew, been such a busy little bee as of late, but will be back soon.....for one day......until I go to LA.
