I am officially done for the year.


When I saw the most disgusting, smug, disgraceful, reprehensible, piece of garbage walk off the field of the Clink on Saturday with a smile, I knew this was the proper shit flavored icing to this turd cake of 2016. Not only is this the worst Christmas I have ever had, this has been one bad year overall.

I am not the only one who has experienced the arduous and soul-ripping claws of 2016; many of my friends have had their own personal and social aspects of their lives tarnished.

I simply cannot write anything humorous or insightful during this joyless and depressing time, so I think it is best to let time pass, try to regroup, and come back in 2017 with something worthwhile.


So goodbye 2016, I'll let John Oliver speak for all of us about our feelings:
