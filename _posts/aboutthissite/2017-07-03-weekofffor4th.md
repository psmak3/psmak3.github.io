Happy 4th to everyone who still considers your country great, fantastic, or whatever. 

I will be taking this week off from the Spew to reflect on such things like, well, my job. 


So have a great week filled with hot dogs, lemonade, beer, fireworks, jorts, cut-off tees, and other things that apparently are classified as 'Americana'. 


Just please don't blow yourself up. 



See you in a week!!!!
