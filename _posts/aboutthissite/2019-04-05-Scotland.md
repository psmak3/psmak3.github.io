My friends, sorry I have been gone so long. I have had soooo much to say but...........


I've also have sooooooooomuch work. :(





And now guess what? I'm going on a huge trip to Scotland next week. Say what? 

Yes. Scotland. Dream vacation, full of whisky, bagpipes, and lake monsters.


This is a 2 week excursion, so once again I will not be updating this blog during that time.


But when I return, I will have many stories to tell. 

Trust me, you will want to read about this trip.


Until then.................
