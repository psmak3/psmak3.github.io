Yes!! It has been too long, my friend. Over 2 1/2 years of silence, of complacency, of a void created by my torpor, is now finally over!!


So the first question: where in the hell were you, you ass?!?!

Well, a lot has happened over the past 800+ days.

- I got married.

- We bought a home.

- My love for whiskey has deepened.

- Dune finally came out, and it was awesome!

- I think there was a group of hillbillies who stormed the Capitol... nah...that had to be a dream.

- I read my first book since high school. Sure, it had mostly pictures, but it still counts.

- I am now a puckhead.

- I am really into judging people forging knives: let me be clear.....I am into the JUDGING and ASSESSING of people forging knives, me actually making a knife (although I have :) ).

- And there is this thing called COVID that that you may have heard of, that has pretty much ruined all my plans for travel. However, for all it's faults, has has bared the soul (and intelligence) of individuals on this planet.


But, as the world turns, sometimes the more things change, the more they stay the same. Such as....

- Disney hijacking all relevant franchises and then put it in Mickey's meat grinder and shape these films into the same format over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Wait, did our Marvel heroes save the universe again? No way............




- The Seahawks still cannot draft or diagnose any offensive or defensive lineman talent to save their team.


- 35% of our national population is delusional, power-hungry, or just simply mentally slow.


- I still have waaaaaay too many opinions on waaaaay too many things I know waaaaaaay too little about.


So on that note, WELCOME BACK!! There is so much to talk about and I hope I can tackle at least a fair percentage of it for you all. I plan on writing daily once again but with a slightly different daily focus. I hope my 5-7 readers will return to the site, read a post or two when you need a diversion, enjoy the random spewings of a middle-aged married man living in uptown Seattle.
