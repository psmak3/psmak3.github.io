In honor of my favorite day of the year, President's Day, I will be busy reflecting on all the presidents and their important deeds to make us the country we are today. 

Or watch Seinfeld reruns while playing Candy Crush.

Either way, there will be no whimsical musing about my life and times in respect to the 18 great presidents we have had.
