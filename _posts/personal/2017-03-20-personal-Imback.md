I'm back! Yes, after 10 relaxing days in the sun and fun of Tucson, Arizona, I am back to grey and clammy Seattle to hash out quality reading and entertainment for all.


My week and a half in Tucson was a lot of fun; seeing old family and friends, eating a lot of tasty food, watching countless NCAA games, basking in the sun, and sleeping in. Trust me, I did not want to leave.


I mean who would want to leave a place where everything comes so easy? No traffic, predictable weather, parking spaces, and everything is so cheap! I could have used another week of that.


But alas, all good things must come to an end. Duty calls, and so does my dog. Yes, I am back in Seattle. Although I was a bit melancholy about the return, the minute I smelled the urine-soaked walls of the Westlake and Pine Light Rail stop, I knew I was in the right spot.


Tucson, you WERE my home and a great place to visit (I'll be back soon enough), but Seattle IS my home.

And I think I like that.
