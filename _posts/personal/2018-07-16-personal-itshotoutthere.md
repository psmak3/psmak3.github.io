So before I launch into this, remember where I am from.

I was born in the heat. I was raised in the heat. I spent my life in the heat. So the last thing you get to say to me is that I do not know the heat.


OK, now that is out of the way.........



It is so hot here in Seattle this week!!!


Record temperatures this week; 80-90 degrees.....Celsius!!!!


Just kidding, it was Fahrenheit. But still, that is hot.



Now before you get into it with me on this with words like 'oh that is not that hot', or 'I don't feel sorry for you'. Well, you should feel sorry for me. Remember, I was born in the heat. I was raised in the heat. I spent my life in the heat. So the last thing you get to say to me is that I do not know the heat.



Let me tell you why this Seattle heat is more harsh than that simple 90 degree number.


First off, there is no AC in Seattle. None at all. Has not been invented yet. That type of technology has not made it here up north. Nope. So you can imagine that with no AC, you are feeling the brunt all of those 90 of those Daniel Fahrenheit's degrees. In Arizona, the temperature is around 105 right now, and yes that is hot. But unlike Seattle, AC technology runs amok much like the mighty buffalo once did in Montana. So one does not feel all the 105 scorch; more like 80 of it. Huge difference.


Secondly, the sun rises early and sets late in Seattle right now. From about 5am to 10pm, that blistering sun pulsating its 85 degrees rays upon thee has 17 hours to accumulate, with only 7 hours of respite. Unlike Arizona, where the sun rises at around 10am and sets at around 7pm (+- 8 hours), which even the most basic math will show that it gives that sun less time to generate heat. 


Thirdly, well, there are only two things really.




Anyway, it is hot here in Seattle, and possibly hotter here than anywhere else based on the before-mentioned arguments. So please, when I complain about that heat here, don't pass back 'facts' like 'well, it is hotter here' or 'don't be such a wimp'. Give me your pity, that's all I really ask.
