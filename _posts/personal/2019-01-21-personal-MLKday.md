So today, probably like yourself, I have the day off. 


But for what reason?



Is it because it is MLK day, or because it is Civil Rights Day?

Well, it turns out in my case, it is because of MLK. But if you lived in Arizona or New Hampshire, it is due to Civil Rights.

So yes, in 48/50 states, MLK is the only person to have a day off solely for him. Fair? Not sure about that. I also think people like the founder of this country and others who held the union together during a Civil War may deserve a day as well. But what do I know? 

Either way, I, like many Americans, will use this time to watch TV and not do anything worthwhile.
