*It is coming.....it is coming......it is almost here!!!! The NFL is starting up once again and I cannot be happier. So the Spew is engaging in a week-long celebration of all things football.*


Football is the best sport of all. This was discussed a bit in the 'Global' post. And I quote:

<br>

'Football is the perfect fusion of science and art: the hyper-analytical nature of strategy and the athletic beauty of the brutal ballet.'


<br>


Wise words.



But football is even more to me. Some of my earliest memories revolve around football.

One of my first sports memories (who am I kidding, I only remember sports things) was the 1982 NFL season; the strike. Teams only played 9 games, Mark Moseley won the MVP (a kicker of all things) and the dreaded Washington team won the Super Bowl. I remember John Riggins cutting through the Dolphins D-line like a hot knife through butter-like spread. 

I remember in 1991 when me and my pals invented our own Fantasy Football scoring system, well before FF became en vogue.


I remember in 1992 when the U of A beat the #1 ranked Washington Huskies 16-3.

I remember 1997 where I saw the greatest Super Bowl of all time: Broncos vs Packers and seeing Elway finally win one.


I remember 2005 where Seattle got the shaft versus the Steelers.

I remember 2007 and 2011 where Eli double-punked Belichick and Co. 

I remember 2013, my first year in Seattle and as a welcome gift gave me their first Super Bowl victory. I forget what happened in 2014....


But what I remember the most is the feel I get every year around this time: the leaves fall, the air is crisper, the vibe of the city changes, an overwhelming excitement swells in my belly. 


Football is coming. And more memories will be created.
