Over the past week, I was in Denver visiting some family. Now I haven't been to Denver in over 15 years, so obviously a lot has changed. Much of it for the better, at least per Newsweek who as recently as last year ranked Denver as the #1 city in America. This was a mantle previously owned by Seattle, which has recently moved down the list due to traffic and housing cost concerns.


Anyway, I did a little recon mission in Denver to see how 'great' this city is. Below is my comparisons between the Emerald City and the Mile High City:


- Overall look: Denver is in the mountains. Seattle is near the water. And has a mountain. **Advantage: Seattle**


- Transportation: Denver has a light rail coming from all 4 directions. A bit pricey, but very well constructed. Seattle has one light rail which is cheaper, but goes on;y one way. Denver freeway system is much wider than Seattle. **Advantage: Denver**

- Stadiums: Mile High Stadium is a palace. The Pepsi Center is nice. Coors Field is pretty as well. They are all around downtown within 3 miles of each other, connected by said light rail. Century Link is a great place, but this Mile High Stadium is awesome. Safeco looks the same as Coors, but overlooks my condo from across the water, so that's a plus. Not until Seattle finally erects their state-of-the-art arena near the Space Needle, Denver wins this race. **Advantage: Denver**

- Sports Talk Shows: Denver has 3 24 hour sports stations. One is called 'Orange and Blue', all Broncos all the time. None of these stations acknowledge they have a MLB playoff team in their backyard. Seattle has 3 stations as well. And they find time to talk about baseball. Better hosts as well. **Advantage: Seattle**

- Homeless: Not even close. **Advantage: Denver**


- Scary White Trash Supremacists Who Wear Hunting Gear in the City: Not even close. **Advantage: Seattle**


- Landmarks: Denver has a mint. Seattle has the Space Needle.  **Advantage: Seattle**

- Craft Beer: Denver has New Belgium along with some other dandies. Seattle has more than you can count. **Advantage: Seattle**

- Music: Denver has John Denver. Seattle doesn't have John Denver. **Advantage: Seattle** 


- Affordability: Denver is a bit pricey, but their renting/housing is manageable. Seattle.....not so much and is going the wrong way. **Advantage: Denver**

- Pot: Way too much for each city. But Denver has fewer ads for their stores. **Advantage: Denver**


- Sitcoms: Mork and Mindy for Denver/Boulder. Seattle, well, Frasier. **Advantage: Seattle** 

- Pretentiousness: God, Seattle can be so exhausting with their 'causes' and their righteousness. **Advantage: Denver**

- Rich People: Gates/Bezos cannot be beat. **Advantage: Seattle** 

- Businesses: Amazon, Costco, Microsoft, Boeing, Alaskan Air versus....well...Chipotle. **Advantage: Seattle** 



- City Colors: Seattle is all blue/green; ocean and sky. Denver has some brown, orange, and other mining-ish colors. **Advantage: Seattle**

- Downtown: Denver has a lot of cool stuff there, but it is a bit corporate. Seattle has the ocean and Pike's Market. **Advantage: Seattle**

- City Council: Well, Denver has 4 teams to Seattle's 2. And their downtown, although not as good, is organized by the city better, with free buses and areas blocked off from normal traffic. Seattle is a mess downtown because the City is too lazy to fix things. **Advantage: Denver**

**Final Score: Seattle-11, Denver-7**


Unlike Super Bowl XLVIII, this one went to the wire. Denver is a great city and is very similar to Seattle in more ways than not. someday soon I will journey back. But home is sweet, and home is here. So huzzah Emerald City, you are the winner!! 

It's hard to top this place.
