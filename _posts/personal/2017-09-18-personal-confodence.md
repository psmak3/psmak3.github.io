I hate people with confidence.


I know, I know. We have been taught our entire lives that confidence is important and we should gravitate to those who possess this special trait of self-admiration. But I am no fan of those people.


I find confident people smug and off-putting; with all of their ideas of 'being good at things', 'people liking them', and that general sense of 'belief'............I just hate that.


Why do these people think they are so great? Don't they realize that the mere fact they think they are so exceptional maximizes everyone they encounter? Where is the healthy sense of self-doubt? Why does this confident ass think that he/she is so wonderful and different out of the literally 7 billion people on this earth? Where is the humility? Why don't these people realize that they pretty much suck like all the rest of us and should never engage in thoughts of grandeur.



Now some people will argue that arrogance is not the same as confident, and what I am describing is more arrogance than confidence. Well, I say stop splitting hairs! They pretty much are the same thing; loving yourself, thinking you can accomplish anything, blah blah blah.


And since when has that idea of 'you can do anything if you set your mind to it' bullpoo started? Maybe with this quote:

'Whether you think you can or whether you think you can't, you're right.'

Yeah Harry Ford. Whatever. I always love it when successful people credit themselves over random chance and help from others. 


Simply not true. Think I can become the world's fastest man (or woman for that matter) if I truly believed I could do it? Of course not!! How about if I worked really really hard on being fast, now can I do it? Hell no!! There are people out there with a better genetic make-up for those things. So no, you just can't do anything you want if you put your mind to it. 


Self-confidence....self-schmonfidence!! We need to value the person who is humble, realizes their place in the world, and doesn't grandstand over others with a superior sense of self. Is the glass half empty? NO!!! Is the glass half full? NO!!! Just drink the damn water and stop thinking you are something you are not!
